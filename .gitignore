Chronous - Your Watch E-commerce Journey Begins! 🚀
I'm excited to guide you through building your first full-stack project! Let me break this down into manageable steps.

STEP 1: Project Setup & Structure
This is where we start - Don't move forward until you complete this!

What you'll do:
Create the project structure
Initialize Git and GitHub
Set up the backend skeleton
Detailed Instructions for Step 1:
Part A: Create Folders & Initialize
bash
# Create main project folder
mkdir chronous-ecommerce
cd chronous-ecommerce

# Create backend and frontend folders
mkdir backend
mkdir frontend

# Initialize Git
git init
Part B: Create GitHub Repository
Go to GitHub.com
Click "New Repository"
Name it: chronous-ecommerce
Keep it Public (or Private if you prefer)
Don't initialize with README (we'll do it manually)
Click "Create Repository"
Part C: Connect Local to GitHub
bash
# In your chronous-ecommerce folder
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/chronous-ecommerce.git
